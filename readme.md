Hereâ€™s how you can create a detailed `README.md` file for your project. We'll include:

1. **Project Title**
2. **Introduction**

4. **How to Use**
5. **How the Prediction Works**
6. **Examples of Predictions** with sample images for Mithila, Paubha, Mandala, and Thangka paintings.

# Art Classification Backend

This project is a backend application that uses a deep learning model to classify images of different types of traditional art. The model predicts the class of the image provided by the user.

Supported Art Types:
- Mithila Painting
- Paubha Painting
- Mandala Art
- Thangka Painting

## Features
- Accepts images in any format, converts them to `.jpg` if needed, and preprocesses them to the required dimensions.
- Predicts the art category of the input image using a trained TensorFlow model.
- Returns the prediction in JSON format.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.7 or above installed on your system.
2. Install required libraries using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow pillow django
   ```

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/art-classification-backend.git
cd art-classification-backend
```

### Set Up the Django Project
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd image_classifier_backend
   ```
2. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## How to Use

### Endpoint: `/predict`
This endpoint accepts POST requests with an image file and returns the predicted art category.

#### Example Request
Using `cURL`:
```bash
curl -X POST -F "image=@path/to/your/image.jpg" http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict/
```

#### Example Response
```json
{
  "predicted_class": "Mithila Painting"
}
```

---

## How the Prediction Works
1. The image is first converted to `.jpg` format if it is not already in this format.
2. The image is resized to `224x224` pixels and normalized.
3. The preprocessed image is passed through a trained TensorFlow model.
4. The model outputs probabilities for each class, and the class with the highest probability is returned.
